# Shrinkage Estimation of the Covariance Matrix for Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data files for my master's thesis titled "Shrinkage Estimation of the Covariance Matrix for Portfolio Optimization." The thesis explores the application of shrinkage estimation techniques to improve the accuracy of covariance matrix estimation in portfolio optimization.

## Files Included
- **MasterThesis_Talia.pdf**: This file contains the PDF version of my master's thesis.
- **MasterThesis_RCode.Rmd**: This R Markdown file contains the R code used for data analysis and generating results presented in the thesis.
- **Data_IS and Data_OS**: This folder contains the Excel files used for analysis.
